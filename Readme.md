# *uick*

User interface components kit.

**WIP -  YET NOT VALID TO USE IN REAL PROJECTS**

uick aims to be a framework for building rich and customizable user interfaces for modern web browsers. It's composed of multiple UI components, which are completely agnostic and have a single responsibility. If you want selects, pick the `ui-select` component, if you want checkboxes, use `ui-checkbox` and so on…

Each component and *uick* itself are modular [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS) components managed by default with [component](https://github.com/component/component) (the package manager) and they include their own styles, images, scripts, etc.

uick is under development but if you are interested you can continue reading some information at the [Wiki](https://github.com/vieron/uick/wiki).
